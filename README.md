# Envmorobot

A system for enviroment modeling for mobile robots.

This system was developed in the academic environment in the course
"Computational Systems". In this project you may define a geometric map and
select a start and end points for a robot mission, then you may select a
technique for generating paths by building a graph. Those techniques are:
discretizing, building square cells, building a quad tree and building a
visibility graph.

System requeriments:

- GNU/Linux Operating System
- Any C++ compiler (clang preferably)
- Qt5
- Aleph-w 

TODO:
- Write doc.
